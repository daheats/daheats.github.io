> Hello and welcome to my first post on my new domain/blog! In the spirit of continuous self improvement, I had a realization with my therapist...I always focus on what I could have done better, and what I did that was wrong. To some, this may seem perfectly normal but when you focus simply on how much you screwed up, how dumb you *think* you are, etc. etc. it becomes a self deprecating and toxic environment that we make for ourselves. Something has become very clear to me and that's my inablity to focus on the good things in life. This is an exercise to hopefully get better at that. 

One of my major accomplishments that I never thought would happen is my break-up with Ambien. I have been on and off (mostly on) Ambien for the better part of at least 7 years. I've always had a very difficult time sleeping - probably due to anxiety. I can't turn my brain off at night. With the seizure-like epsiodes I was experiencing along with thoughts of starting my own family soon I knew it was time to cut the cord I've been so reliant on. I would do so many WEIRD things on Ambien - I'm surprised Dave didn't give me my marching papers after the time I woke up just long enough to say "All the TVs in the house are going to kill us!"... and proceeded to go right back to sleep zZzzZzz... So many other stories! I'm so thankful I wasn't one of those Ambien users who got in a car and drove (yes this can totally happen). 

I knew it was going to be a difficult transition. There were times I had run out of my prescription and I had to go a night without. Night terrors, sweats, shaking... NO SLEEP AT ALL. It would be ok though eventually... I hoped. It took about 5 days for the withdrawal symptoms to disipate. I kept plugging away at work and at home - Ambien wasn't going to win this time. 

Fast forward a couple months to now I am not sleeping a full 8 hours a night like I had but I feel better. When I wake up in the morning I literally jump out of bed and most mornings get a nice workout in before I have to head off to work. Prior, I'd be so dazed and almost comotose that it would be extremely difficult to get moving in the morning. When your commute is 90 minutes to work... "ain't nobody got time for that!"

So yes, major accomplishment number 1 - Ambien can now be categorized with the rest of my maniacal exs!
