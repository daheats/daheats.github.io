For the last few years, I’ve struggled with my body image. I think most of us probably do at some point in our lives. When I was younger I never had an issue with staying fit. Whether it was gymnastics, diving, swimming every day over the summer, or breakdancing (yes that totally went down!)... I was always active. After I snapped my arm breakdancing my activity level dwindled and I wasn’t able to do all of the cool things I was able to do before - I was also getting older - yikes. I know some of you probably reading this are saying “geesh you’re not old, I’m old!” but getting older came with a host of new responsibilities. Gone were the days where I could throw caution to the wind and risk another injury, though those days were kick-ass. 

My body started to change as a result and I was starting to hate what I saw in the mirror every day. I was no longer the size 2  that I used to be and coming to that realization wasn’t working for me. I missed my old body. 

When I started losing weight in preparation for my wedding, I finally realized that no matter what I did I’d never be a size 2 again - and that was ok. I remembered that although I had been in shape all of those years I wasn’t a happy kid or a happy teenager, I wasn’t even happy in my early 20’s. I had dealt with depression and some awful things that led me to not eat right (if at all). Even though I had been a size 2, I was a size 2 for all of the wrong reasons; I wasn’t healthy. 

I lost some weight for my wedding but I didn’t go all out. It wasn’t until I started having seizure-like episodes and trying to come off my Ambien that my neurologist suggested more exercise for vascular health. I was ok with my body but I wanted to be HAPPY with my body and this was just the push I needed - I was desperate for a good night’s sleep without the “sleep crack”. I decided to do some cardio for 30 minutes a day and I switched up my diet. I started seeing the “gains” of my work and didn’t want to stop. They say in order to make something a habit to do it for 30 days and that’s exactly what I did. I added swimming  into the equation because it was low impact and I wanted to switch my routine up a bit. backFast forward to now and I’m down ten pounds from when I started this new adventure. The exercise has definitely helped with my sleep and I am happy with my body again. There’s still some things I’m waiting for to come into line with the rest of my body, but I’m proud of my work so far. 

Things I Did to Lose 10:

- No soda - though sometimes I have ginger ale if my stomach is “off” 
- Strict diet during the workweek unless I have lunch plans with friends. Even if I do go out I’ll typically order something like a salad. 
- For breakfast - I do blueberries with greek yogurt and a little bit of honey, a hard-boiled egg, and a stick of mozzarella cheese.
- For lunch - a chicken caesar wrap on a chia seed or honey wheat wrap.
- For snack - clementines or a few pieces of dark chocolate 
- For dinner - we’ve doing Hello Fresh and the meals are a lot healthier than what I might decide to make on my own or pick up for dinner (3x a week) 
- Cardio at least 30 minutes 3-4 times a week
- Swimming at least 30-45 minutes (whenever I want - I love to swim)
Having a “swim friend” who’s a monster in the pool is helpful. I have someone to push me the extra bit I wouldn’t have pushed myself. 
- I love ice cream HOWEVER, I decided to do gelati and I’m watching the serving size there. It’s a nice treat! 
-I don’t diet on the weekends - I still want to allow myself to enjoy yummy food. But! That leads me to my next point…
- I was reading <a href="http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Year-of-Yes/Shonda-Rhimes/9781476777122"> Shonda Rhimes - Year of Yes </a> and she had mentioned in the book that she allowed herself to eat whatever she wanted with just one rule. When she stopped enjoying that food, she’d stop eating. This thought process stuck in my mind and now I’m more aware of if I’m eating to just eat or I’m eating because I enjoy what I’m eating. I found most times I was just eating to eat so now I just stop when my stomach is satisfied.
