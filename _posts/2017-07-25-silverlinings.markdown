It’s hard to believe we’ve been in Washington for a month
already. We’re still getting settled with the dogs and the dogs are
settling in too. Ecky and Ada are getting used to apartment life.
Ecky’s getting used to apartment life *again*. Unfortunately, Ada
hasn’t known anything *but* living in a house so every little noise
sets her off into a barking frenzy.

I find myself missing basically everything about home - friends, family,
work, HubBub, cheesesteaks, and just good food in general. We, 
unfortunately, missed the wedding of our friends Jay and Jenna which
was a hell of a doozie for us. Where we’re living temporarily, 
I haven’t had a wow food experience. Those are so important, 
to me anyways! Missing SO many things.

In the midst of my “woe is me” moment I stopped myself and I thought
for a brief bit about the things I was enjoying about Seattle and its
suburbs. Which by the way, we don’t actually live *IN* Seattle we live
on the outskirts. Seattle house pricing is not cheap (thanks Glamazon)
and is WAY out of our price range. Anyhow, I started to think about the
things I liked about my new place of residence so here’s the list of
the good since I’ve already embarked on the bad and the ugly part.

- I went outside of my comfort zone thanks to a reach out from the
one and only [Mariatta](https://twitter.com/mariatta) and spoke at a
[PuPPy](https://twitter.com/ps_python) meetup in Seattle. I met some
wonderful people and plan on going to their monthly meetings going
forward. Since I’m brand new to the development world, learning about
what everyone is up to in their different fields was eye opening. I
spoke at this [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/events/241128036/) 
and the feedback was amazing and so supportive.

- I found a [pool](http://itallhappenshere.org/swim.html) so I could
keep up with my swimming routine. I was enrolled at Pottruck right
before I left and swam a lot
(at least up until *get this sh!t dun* month) so I was excited to get
back to it. I’ve found having a routine is key to making it work here. 
I go every day except for Wednesday & Saturday and swim for
45 minutes to an hour depending on how I’m feeling.

- We have [Mount Rainier](https://www.nps.gov/mora/index.htm).
I know it sounds like I’m bragging… oh, wait I am. For those of you
that come to visit (I sure hope ya’ll come and visit) it
almost looks fake. You can’t always see it depending on the day but
when you can, it never gets old. When the house is finished, you’ll
be able to sit and see it from the back deck on a clear sunny day.

- If you drive anywhere around here, to Seattle, to the new house, 
etc. etc. you have brilliant breathtaking views. There’s always
something to busy your eyes. Where the temporary apartment
is (as much as this apartment grades on my nerves), part of
[Puget Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound) is
literally minutes away. We don’t have to drive two and a half hours to
get to water, it’s literally everywhere here!

We get to watch our house being built from scratch. We plan on this
being our forever home
(at least until we retire which is sooooo far in the future). It’s not
every day you get to basically design a house and watch it be made in
front of your eyes. As Dave has described, we had our choices of
floor plan but all of the interior fixtures and colors will be what
we choose. It’s great to go out every Sunday and see the progress.
I’m so happy that we have [JK Monarch](http://jkmonarch.com/) as our
builders because so far (fingers crossed), almost every Sunday we’ve
gone out there’s been some bit of progress on the lot.

- We were forced into being minimalists. We went from a house to a one
bedroom apartment. Now we have our Pod which is amazing but there was
no way in hell that everything we had was going to fit in it. This
forced us to really look at all of our “stuff”,
(which in the end is really just “stuff”) and make some needed
decisions about what was really important. We would have liked to take
some more of our furniture with us but over time that could and will be
replaced. We don’t have much now but home is what you make of
it - so we’re doing ok. 

- I haven’t met many new folks outside of the PuPPy meetup I went to;
however, our buyer’s agent Michelle is turning into a great friend.
She’s from Pennsylvania originally so she just gets us. She also grows
a lot of fruit and is willing to share! I picked up some plums she had
picked yesterday, Thank you, Michelle!

- As much as I miss Pennsylvania, my colleagues, and my friends and
family, there was a lot of deep rooted pain back there from my
childhood that stemmed all the way into my early twenties. Putting *ALL*
that space between me and Pennsylvania has proven to be a breath of
fresh air (I’m sure the air is fresher here), but you get my drift.
My therapist thought a change of scenery and a new routine would do me
some good and even though there are low points to moving a whole coast
away, big picture, I can see what she meant.

This list may seem short but it’s what I think about when I get into
the “woe is me” moments. I’m a people person so I miss people but we’re
finding ways! Some beloved colleagues at work have resurrected a
[Beam telepresence robot](https://telepresencerobots.com/robots/suitable-technologies-beam-pro)
I can control so I can go “visit” people at work. Though warning, if I
can’t make it up stairs Wharton friends, you might hear me SOS-ing
for a lift. 

The silver lining to all of this is I get to look forward to visiting
in November for my twice a year touchback to Wharton so I can continue
to hold onto my job. This time around I’ll be staying with my Tomski
family whom I absatootley love. While I plan on working the whole week, 
on nights I do want to get out and visit with friends and family to
hold us over until January when Dave and I will both be coming out for
a late Christmas visit. While we would have liked to do an actual
Christmas visit, closing on the house is VERY close to Christmas
so we had to delay.

As for me, I’ll see everyone in November and until then - I’ll work on
building this list up more and revisit in another blog post later on.
