As the last few days of my twenties tick away I find myself feeling different about this birthday, I find myself feeling excited and proud. Not all of my twenties were amazing but I can look back over the last decade and I know that where I could have given up… I didn’t. I fought as hard as I could to get my head above water. I think this is why thirty is so special to me. I thought it would be interesting to look back on what I’ve done and learned over the past decade. Not all of them will be positive but they are positive in the sense that I learned valuable lessons - so that counts right…? 

- I learned to breakdance and dare I say I was pretty good at it. 
- I got my first “big girl” job at Medcomp where I met some of my nearest and dearest friends. 
-My heart finally became complete when I saw Ecklo and his big doofus self in the pet store. I made a promise to him I’d be back to get him and I did! Life wouldn’t be the same without that fluffer butt in it. All the times I cried into him and he would just sit there and let me. He’s getting older now and it saddens me to think he’ll leave at some point. 
- I learned that no matter how nice someone acts that I always need to trust my gut instinct because 98% of the time my first instinct is always spot on.
- I went through what will probably be the most traumatic life experience I’ll have in my life in my early 20’s. 
- I learned that life is always worth living when there are great friends to help you through the darkest of your days. 
- I learned that although my father and I hadn’t talked in quite some time that he will always have my back. That he will always fight for his daughter because he is my Dad and that’s what daddy’s do...they protect their daughters. 
- I almost snapped my humerus in half doing a freeze transition into an air chair while breakdancing at Reeds. A plate and nine screws later this girl isn’t doing things that risky anymore. Lesson learned. PS It wasn’t very funny. 
- I took a chance on EHarmony and met this amazing nerdy software developer who I ended up marrying. He’s so lucky to have me! lolol
- I got my very first passport! 
- I used that passport to go on my very first trip outside of North America (I had been to Canada when I was 18) this time Germany in January… cold but beautiful! 
- I got an even bigger big girl job when Frank Daknis and Sarah Toms hired me at Almac! Again, I met so many of my great friends here. 
- I was the subject matter expert for a 50 million dollar project called COSMOS. Both my boss and boss’ boss trusted me enough to take control of the hardware and it’s configurations. It was a stressful time but we launched! I enjoyed the challenge! 
- I learned the loss of a pet hurts something fierce. RIP Kelly. 
- I landed a job at the best business school in the world. I still don’t know how that happened but it did! 
- For the first time in my life, I had someone tell me I didn’t have the mindset to be a systems administrator.  To this day it replays in my head like a record. #impostersyndrome probably started here. This is why you should really think about what you’re saying and how it can affect others. 
- I was promoted to a systems administrator role at Wharton after proving I was ready for more. A group of my colleagues helped me get enough confidence back to apply. 
- I learned about this thing called Powershell which is what I’d mark as my first journey with “code” and where I learned about automating all the things.
- I stayed up a total of 48 hours without any sleep so I could do two major projects at work… this is where I learned that heats needs her brain sleep. Both things got done, BUT the upgrading of virtual environments could have been cleaner for sure! I think this is where self-care in IT first made its point. 
- I got certified in Project Management for IT! A wonderful few days in New York learning about critical paths and playing poker… SCRUM poker.
- I got married! What a wonderful day! 
- We got Ada! She’s the snuggle bug for me that Ecklo refuses to be no matter how hard I hold him against his will hehehe
- I learned my spine will follow the same footsteps my Mom’s did. I hope that doesn’t lead to spinal surgery a decade from now… EEK
- I learned that the kid’s in high school who bully others exist in adulthood. 
- I learned that whatever their issue is, was their problem and not mine. I am fine just the way I am and most people appreciate my personality and my work ethic. This took way too long to figure out though. One of those sad things but I learned from it and I’m better for the lesson learned. 
- I put together a talk on Internet Safety for Kids for Penn & Wharton staff and faculty. 
- I helped my good friend and co-worker <a href="https://twitter.com/FlipperPA">Tim Allen</a> out with hosting an international conference about the Django web framework and I met SO MANY WONDERFUL PEOPLE like my very best friend <a href="https://twitter.com/webology">Jeff Triplett</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/craigbruce">Craig</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/laceynwilliams">Lacey</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/OssAnna16">Anna</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/Transition">Kojo</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/shaysler">Stacey</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rlconley">Rebecca C.</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/saradgore">Sara</a>, so many to name if I’m missing you it’s just because it’s late! 
- I raised some money for this conference - dafuq! Who knew this girl could raise funds? Doing it again this year in 2017… wish me luck! 
- I started to learn Python… the only reason I decided to learn Python is because of DjangoCon. A great technical community supports Django and all of it’s interested parties whether you’re a newbie like me or an expert. People like the Ola’s make really great documentation for Python/Django and DjangoGirls which helped me learn and make sense of it all. Thanks Ladies <3 
- I enjoyed a lateral move/promotion under one of my mentors and ended up essentially where I had hoped to be when I first applied at Wharton. I remember being so excited and telling Joe Cruz and him telling me to calm down lol. I wasn’t quite ready at the time but it was interesting how the circle of life brought me back to him 3 years later.
- I got ITIL Foundations Certified.
- Holy crap I finally touched a Linux server, thanks to KaWing and Gavin. 
- I started to find my voice within Wharton Computing. How things could be better! I think people appreciated my feedback which was shocking.
- I did something I swore I’d never do. I got a Mac as my main work laptop. There’s a picture floating around of me with a sign that says “PC’s Rule… Mac’s not so much”. I remember seething when Kim, Megan, and Linh got all new Macs for their design skills at Medcomp. Now there’s really no sign of Windows anywhere at my desk. I still love my Surface...but I don’t know how this happened. 
- I cracked open Ansible and wrote a very simple playbook but I did it… thanks to Gavin for teaching me the ins and outs and allowing me to be a n00b which takes the utmost patience. 
- I wrote my first Alexa Skill, Happy Days which I published with Amazon and it took off! Amazon has it front page still, I believe in the Zen & Relax section. Oh and I wrote it in Python… who am I? 
- I signed up to talk at a Wharton Computing quarterly about Alexa development and AWS. I remember when I first started at Wharton Computing I said, “I could never speak at one of these”...never say never!
- I learned that not all tech organizations are like DjangoCon and what a shame that is. I know I want to raise money for organizations that put their money back into their communities, not ones that have no explanation of where the money goes… oof. The great thing that came out of that was I got to work more closely with Donna, I got to meet Deirdre and Jeanette who are AMAZING women. 
- Some lovely ladies and I from Wharton Computing started the Women of Wharton IT group for the women in Wharton Computing. 
- I’m now a member of Django Software Foundation. 
- I learned that I have PTSD from the trauma in my early 20’s. If I don’t control the stress in my life, this can cause seizure-like symptoms some of you witnessed last year. I was happy to learn my brain was physically fine at least. 
- I started swimming again and I love it! I feel like I get stronger in the pool every week. 
- I learned about fighting fair...
- I started to learn more about AWS in a production environment along with starting to learn a little bit of Docker… Thank you, <a href="https://twitter.com/fwiles">Frank</a>&<a href="https://twitter.com/SarahEToms">Sarah</a>!
- I was finally able to detox myself off of Ambien. My sleep isn’t as great as it was but I feel more alert now in general, not just when I wake up. 
- We started eating healthier by ordering Hello Fresh deliveries.
- Only time can heal the deepest wounds.


All these things! Wow! I have been a busy girl transitioning into a woman throughout the last ten years. My biggest takeaway and this is going to sound cruel but let’s be honest… there’s a fair number of people that just suck! Such a harsh reality that even as I write this rings true. But no matter how hard people suck, you can’t make them suck less. It’s their choice to be that way and no matter how hard you try, they’re not going to change. The only thing you can do is change how you react. My reaction is that instead of getting hung up on the negative people in the world - the people that want to make others unhappy, to surround myself with all of the really good people in my life. Luckily the good people in my life always outweigh the bad so it’s not difficult. Doing this has made my life so much happier and beneficial. 

Going into the next decade I’m definitely better equipped than ever with the tools to make the 30-40 stretch a kickass ten years! I am so looking forward to celebrating my 30th birthday for everything I’ve accomplished and fought through to make it here and to just be ALIVE. 

Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/webology">Jeff Triplett</a> for proofing this post and allowing my "heatsisms" to fly.
